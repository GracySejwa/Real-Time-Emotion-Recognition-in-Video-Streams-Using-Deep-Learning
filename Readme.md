Real-Time Emotion Recognition in Video Streams Using Deep Learning
Objective
This project aims to develop a deep learning model capable of recognizing emotions in real-time video streams. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), the system will analyze facial expressions and body language to detect emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise. The model will be trained on a diverse dataset of labeled video clips and optimized for performance on live video feeds, making it suitable for applications in security, customer service, education, and healthcare.

Prerequisite Skills
Python programming
TensorFlow or PyTorch
OpenCV
Techniques Used
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): For feature extraction from facial images and video frames.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): To process temporal dependencies and improve emotion prediction from video sequences.
Dataset Used
FER2013 Dataset: This dataset contains over 35,000 labeled facial images categorized into 7 emotion classes (happy, sad, angry, surprise, fear, disgust, neutral). It is widely used for training emotion recognition models.

Conclusion
The model will detect emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise by analyzing facial expressions and body language. The model will be optimized for performance on live video feeds.
